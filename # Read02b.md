# Read: 02b - Revisions and the Cloud

###First subject: we understood what Version Control is and what the difference between:
* Local Version Control
* Centralized Version Control
* Distributed Version Control. 

#### So the Git is DVCS we can use it as Snapshots, Local Operations, Tracking Changes, Loss of Data, States. 

## But States files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

* Committed : Data is securely stored in a local database

* Modified: The file has been changed but not committed to the database.

* Staged: Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.

####I find some info about Download Git and I found it useful.

###They explain the HTML code command in a perfect way and I noted all this command :

	* Colne
	* Add
	* Status
	* Commit
	* Push
	* Remote
	* reset
