I had Small an idea about Text Editor before, but I didn't know about the difference between text editors and IDEs, so the text editors can edit text, manages text, and manages files and the IDEs can edit the text but we can use it as a file
manager so the IDEs working as a suite of different software all coming together, and very nice to understand the difference, in this case, I have a question, one's time I try use Bi power and I found the BI power accept or need codes, we know that this program more than text editors, so is the BI power is IDEs?

About the Linux Tutorial (1,2&3) articles, now after read those articles I learnt what the ls -a, file mean, cd, pwd, ~ and path .
